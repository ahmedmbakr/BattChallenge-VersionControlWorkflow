\section{Introduction} \label{section: introduction}

In this document, we will describe the details of the preliminary version control workflow.
First, we will discuss the structure of the branches in \Cref{section: branches}, where we have integrated both long-lived and short-lived branches.
Then, we will discuss the issue handling process in \Cref{section: issues handling}, which is used to track and resolve issues in the project.
Finally, we will discuss the continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) process in \Cref{section: CI-CD}, which is triggered when a new commit is created on the develop, release, or the main branches.
