\section{Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD)} \label{section: CI-CD}

As features are being implemented asynchronously, it is important to ensure that all modules work together effectively. However, performing an exhaustive manual set of tests after every feature implementation is impractical. To maintain quality and safety, CI/CD will be implemented when merging from Develop to Release branches. Every release will go through thorough automated tests to ensure it is fully functional and bug-free. If these tests are failed, then the Develop branch will be adjusted and the release will be attempted again by applying a hotfix.
